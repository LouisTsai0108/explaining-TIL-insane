📚 My Learning Projects

👋 Welcome to this repository!
This is a personal space where I keep my learning projects, experiments, and notes.

💡 I am not from a Computer Science background, but I use this place to:

🧑‍💻 Practice coding through small projects

✍️ Write down thoughts about what each piece of code means to me

🔍 Reflect on the process of learning step by step

✨ For me, every line of code is more than just instructions for a machine.
It carries meaning, logic, and sometimes even creativity.
That’s why I want to document not only the what but also the why behind my work.

🚀 Feel free to explore, and maybe some of my notes or projects can be useful or inspiring to you as well.
